# First project

## About me:
My name is Lucas Haigh, I am a student of Western Governors University's Data Analysis/Data Management BS program, and currently working on my Udacity Data Analysis nanodegree. 

## About the Project:
The purpose of this project was to delve into the process of data analysis with a lightweight csv file. I thought up a couple questions that could be investigated with the data from the file, then used pandas DataFrames, Series, and Matplotlib plots to answer those questions. 

This project was written in a jupyter notebook, version 5.9 (LTS) with a python 2.7 kernel. 

This was the comprehensive project for the first course in my Udacity nanodegree, focusing on data analysis and data science. It does not go extremely deep into any single phase of the data analysis process, but rather gives a shallow view of the discovery and structuring phases.

final_project.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file, which will render as an html page when viewed in github. 
final_project_attempt2.html is the second submission of my project, identical the final_project.ipynb but will render as an HTML script when viewed in github.
